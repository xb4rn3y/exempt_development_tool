          question: "What is Exempt Development?",
          answer: "Exempt development is low-impact development that can be carried out without the need for development consent from Council, provided it meets certain criteria set out in State Environmental Planning Policy (SEPP)."
        },
        {
          question: "Why use this tool?",
          answer: "This tool helps you quickly determine if your proposed shed, patio, or similar structure qualifies as exempt development, potentially saving you time and money on development applications."
        },
        {
          question: "Is this tool's assessment legally binding?",
          answer: "No, this tool provides guidance only. For official confirmation, please contact Albury City Council's planning department. Site-specific constraints may apply that aren't covered by this assessment."

      items: [
        {
          question: "What is SEPP?",
          answer: "State Environmental Planning Policy (SEPP) is NSW state-level planning legislation that sets rules for development across the state, including provisions for exempt and complying development."
        },
        {
          question: "What is LEP?",
          answer: "Local Environmental Plan (LEP) is Council's main planning document that sets out zoning, development standards, and environmental protection measures for the local area."
        },
        {
          question: "What is DCP?",
          answer: "Development Control Plan (DCP) provides detailed planning and design guidelines that supplement the LEP, covering matters like building design, landscaping, and parking."
        },
        {
          question: "What are setbacks?",
          answer: "Setbacks are the minimum distances required between a building or structure and the property boundaries. They ensure adequate space for access, privacy, and neighbourhood amenity."
        }

      title: "Structure Requirements",
      icon: <Building className="h-5 w-5" />,
      items: [
        {
          question: "What structures can be exempt development?",
          answer: "Common exempt structures include garden sheds, patios, pergolas, carports, and decks. Each has specific size, height, and setback requirements that must be met."
        },
        {
          question: "What are the height limits?",
          answer: "Most exempt structures are limited to 3 metres in height, though this can vary depending on the type of structure and its location on the property."
        },
        {
          question: "How close can I build to my boundary?",
          answer: "Minimum setbacks typically include: 6m from front boundary, 0.9m from side boundaries, and 0.9m from rear boundary. Requirements may vary based on structure type and size."
        },
        {
          question: "Are there size limitations?",
          answer: "Yes, exempt development typically has maximum floor area limits. For example, sheds are often limited to 20mÂ² floor area, while patios may have different limits."
        }

      icon: <Scale className="h-5 w-5" />,
      items: [
        {
          question: "What if my development isn't exempt?",
          answer: "If your proposed development doesn't qualify as exempt, you'll need to submit a development application (DA) to Council. This involves detailed plans, fees, and an assessment period of 40-60 days."
        },
        {
          question: "Do I need building approval for exempt development?",
          answer: "While exempt development doesn't require development consent, you may still need to comply with building codes and obtain any necessary building certificates or approvals."
        },
        {
          question: "Are there any exemptions to exempt development?",
          answer: "Yes, exempt development may not apply in certain areas such as heritage conservation areas, flood zones, or areas with specific environmental constraints. Always check with Council."
        },
        {
          question: "How much does a development application cost?",
          answer: "DA fees vary depending on the type and value of development. Contact Albury City Council for current fee schedules. Exempt development avoids these costs entirely."
